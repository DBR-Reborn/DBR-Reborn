\e[OBags of holding update: If you have a bag of holding that says small, medium, large, huge or anything of the kind it will not save over a reboot. If you get the new bag of holding it will save over reboots and in your inventory. There is only going to be one size for now (and unless really needed, moving forward). If I were you, I would get rid of the old bags and get a new one from the shop. If you are really nice, send Honspron a tell and I will trade them out for you.
