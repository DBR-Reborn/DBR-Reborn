                  =-=-=- Voidwalker -=-=-=

The Voidwalkers are an enigmatic guild of warriors who harness the power of the rifts between realms. They believe that true strength lies not only in physical prowess but also in the mastery of the void—a place where all things converge and potential is limitless.

Voidwalkers are skilled in combat, specializing in the use of two-handed weapons. They wield Oberon’s weapon, a legendary artifact said to contain the essence of the rift itself. With their immense strength and constitution, they are formidable opponents on the battlefield, capable of enduring great hardships and delivering devastating blows.

In addition to their martial skills, Voidwalkers possess the unique ability to summon weapons from the void. Their spells focus on vacuum damage and manipulation of the battlefield, allowing them to create powerful effects that disrupt enemies and enhance their own combat capabilities. 

The Voidwalkers believe that the rift holds secrets that can unlock untold power. They seek to harness this power not only for themselves but also to protect their realm from threats that lurk beyond. They often explore the boundaries of reality, searching for ancient knowledge and artifacts that can augment their abilities.

However, with great power comes great risk. The Voidwalkers walk a fine line, as the influence of the void can corrupt even the strongest minds. They must constantly strive to maintain their balance between strength and sanity, lest they succumb to the chaotic forces that lie beyond.
